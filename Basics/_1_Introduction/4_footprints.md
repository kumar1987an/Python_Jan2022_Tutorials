# Let's see the fascinating areas python shines.

## Web Development

***Django, Pyramid, Flask, Bottle***

These are the frameworks that are packed with std libraries and modules which simplifies the REST APIs architecture by using protocols like HTTP, SMTP, XML, JSON etc

&nbsp;

## Game Development

***Library like PyGame, Pyglet, PyKyra, PyOpenGL***

Python is the foundation for popular games like Battlefield 2, Frets on Fire, World of Tanks, Disney's Toontown online, Vega Strike and Civilization-IV. Python is used as a scripting language by many game engines.

&nbsp;

## Scientific and Numeric Applications

Python plays major role here and it has massive loaded libraries to deal with. Application like Free-CAD (3D Modeling software) and Abaqus (Finite Element method software) are coded in Python.

***Most famous packages are***

Scipy (scientific numeric library)
Pandas (data analytic library)
IPython (command shell)
Numeric Python (fundamental numeric package i.e numpy)
NLTK (Mathematical and Text analysis)

***Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning***

I dont want to say anything new as you all know that this is the emergening global technology and top search topic all time in google.

***Apart from Scipy, Pandas and Numpy these are the additional modules will be used***

Seaborn, Tableau, Plotly, Matplotlib, Bokeh for data visualization
Kera, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, Caffee, PyTorch, Accord.NET for AI and ML

&nbsp;


## Desktop GUI

*Python offers many toolkits and frameworks for desktop application development*

PyQt, PyGtk, Kicy, Tkinter, WxPython, PyGUI and PySide

&nbsp;


## Software Development

*Python also be used for build control, testing and management.*

SCons is designed explicitly for build control
Buildbot and Apache Gump allow for automated continuous application testing
Roundup and Trac are great for bug tracking and Project Managment

&nbsp;

## Enterprise-Level Business Aplications

Odoo, an all-in-one management software
Tryton, a three-tier general purpose application platform
